# Sports Scoreboard Overview

This scoreboard is designed for sporting events and is based on a match between two teams.

When the program is launched, two windows will open: the basic information window and the scoreboard window.

In the input window, you can enter the name of the competition, team names, game time, etc. In addition, 
you can control the stopping and restarting of the game time according to the referee's signal during the game, 
and the application of attack time according to the transition between offense and defense.

The first version is an early version of my own work, with a very poor design and functionality.
I'm just getting started with coding and will continue to learn and perfect this program as I go.
I would like to encourage anyone who needs it to try it out, and I would love to get some help from coding experts.

For those who can help, I would like to briefly describe the features I would like to see,
1. the program should be implemented on a monitor using a laptop.
2. match time and attack time should be freely modifiable.
3. each team has a certain amount of time to attack and defend - for example, 20 seconds.
4. the clock may be stopped by a signal from the referee, in which case the attacking time must be stopped at the same time.
5. the attacking time should be reset and counted again when the offense switches sides due to a goal by the attacking team 
   (currently implemented as fuzzy-switching-start).
6. a long buzzer should sound at the end of the game, and a short one-second backup buzzer should sound 10 seconds before the end.
7. We will try it out in a practice game and add any necessary improvements.

I would be grateful for your help.
Download it, give it a try, and let us know what you think we can improve.
